/*
    Given an array of intervals, intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number
    of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

    Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3]
    are non-overlapping.

    Example 1:

    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
    Example 2:

    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
    Example 3:

    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

    Constraints:

    1 <= intervals.length <= 105
    intervals[i].length == 2
    -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
